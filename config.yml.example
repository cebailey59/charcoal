# Charcoal supports the following structure:
# - A page has multiple Projects.
# - Projects can have several Sections.
# - Sections have Targets, Attributes and Images
# - Each target is a Graphite command for what to draw
# - The Attributes section gives global attributes for HOW to draw it
# - Each Image shows a title and other local attributes (such as time)
#    for how to draw the end image.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# The format of the config file is as follows:
# 
# Title: Page title
# RenderURL: http://graphite.you.com/URL/to/Rendering/?
# [Project Name]:
#   [Section Name]:
#     Targets:
#       [Name]: [Command]
#       [Name]: [Command]
#       [Name]: [Command]
#     Attributes:
#       [Attribute]: [Value]
#       [Attribute]: [Value]
#       [Attribute]: [Value]
#     Images:
#       [ImageName]:
#         [Attribute]: [Value]
#         [Attribute]: [Value]
#       [ImageName]:
#         [Attribute]: [Value]
#         [Attribute]: [Value]
#
# [Project Name]:
#   ...
#
# (Repeat ad infinitum.)
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Image Sizes
#
# There's a constant gutter of 20px between each image if
# there are multiple images on a line.
# 
# Projects have 920px of "image width." This means you can
# have:
# - a single image 920px wide on a line
# - two images that are each 450px wide (with 20px btwthem)
# - 3 across at 293/294/293px
# - and so on.
#
# Sections have 70px of "image width." This means, most
# commonly, two 370px wide images on a line.
